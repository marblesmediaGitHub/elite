Kevin ,  

Hope you have received some images and logo . It’s been sent from my personal email address if your wondering . 

The biggest usp is we only use purified water . Tap water is processed through a resin filtration system  and the total dissolvable solids that are found in tap water are greatly reduced . Hence this purified water leaves no residue on the car . You can find the best explanation from google not me !  

We comply with a 3 bucket system . Single use bucket for wash with shampoo  / conditioner .using non contaminated clothes , mitt and tools . 
Single use bucket for rinse and again a single bucket for wheel cleaning . 

The van we use can be utilised as a complete self sufficient vehicle . We have a water tank for the purified water that we source locally . We have a petrol fuelled generator that can power a plumbed in jet wash system and wet and dry vacuuming capabilities.

We use Auto  Glym  and Autosmart products from local distributors.

I have been trained by Autosmart on there products , procedures and usage of there products . I hold certificates from Autosmart . 

I have a Churchill Tradesman and professionals insurance policy in force .
